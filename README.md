# sudoku-game
This project features a GUI Sudoku solver using Python (PyQt6) for the interface and Prolog for logic-based solving. It uses CSP and backtracking to model cells, domains, and constraints. Users can play, get hints, validate input, and watch the AI solve using Prolog's constraint logic programming.
